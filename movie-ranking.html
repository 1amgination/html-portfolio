<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>School Days</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime. It changes the perspective on how i see life and exerts zeal on my dailies.</p>
<h3>Cthulu</h3>
<p>Really cool sci-fi movie. It really sets the dark monotone horror setting that you dont see in nowadays movies.</p>
<h3>A Frozen Flower</h3>
<p>Super beautiful film. Really artistic.</p>
